## GoEmotions- Emotion recognition from text

This project is part of the Capstone Project. The goals of this project are as follows:

1. Conduct data exploration to understand the distribution of GoEmotions data. 
2. Build multi-class classification models to determine emotions in given text. <br>
  a. Naive Bayes <br>
  b. Multi-layer Perceptron <br> 
  c. LSTM <br>
3. Develop a web interface to: <br> 
  a. Present data analysis of GoEmotions <br> 
  b. Display emotions in a user-input sentence.
