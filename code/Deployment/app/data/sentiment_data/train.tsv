Probably end of February and all of March before release. I think that's what they did last year	2
I look forward to finally trying the game out and helping you guys pump up those kill counts	1
9 to 4. That's pretty sorry.	0
Maybe if he was still on his rookie contract.	2
That's how I used to feel but contracting oneitis added a heaping shitpile of loneliness and agony on top	0
Amazing shitpost.	1
I never watched any [NAME] films, so. That. 	0
Usually they treat what they know. They cannot write down that they are treating you for BPD until you are officially diagnosed.	2
Well tell me what happened then	2
Females living on Recruit difficulty. Smh	0
To be honest, I have complete sympathy for this woman and she needs help, not prison. 	1
He's stealing J . Huges spotlight... [NAME] proud of himself again.	2
Quit serving money and [NAME] will feed you.	2
Which is bizarre because [NAME] actually dubbed those scenes back in the day, but they apparently never used them ever.	2
It's the right sub but why did we even set-up so defensively in the first place? Utterly bizarre.	2
Played in a dangerous cross which [NAME] should have scored from. Just before [NAME] goal	2
Well that’s just like, your opinion, man	2
I’m on it. Will be recruiting family and friends as well. Thank you 🙏🏻	1
The only one to really be sad about losing is [NAME] tbh	0
I understand why... But it's so sad we have to lie... It breaks my heart...	0
Well shit, time to talk to the wife. It appears she has two husbands.	0
Screaming into a pillow afterwards	2
Well, I say good luck to you !	1
Thanks. I'm in the same boat about being against therapy. Good luck to you too.	1
You said that the illegals who come over the border should be allowed to enter legally.	2

When you're too stupid to realize they showed off character customization in the trailer...	0
Oh my [NAME] stop	2

Too bad =(	0
*tomorrow Thank you for this.	1
Google image him. Hes NEVER had a good haircut.	0
Yeah, hah. 	1
CAN IT JUST BE OPENING DAY? I’m so sick of speculation. Let’s quit the foreplay and just fuck already.	0

They both crazy	1

Except for [NAME] whose remains are either still on the way to Winterfell or lost altogether	2
[NAME] about to dip out real quick	2
I actually really like this, and unironically find it funny. Forgive me.	1
It's because men feel entitled to date young and slim women but when a woman dates tall, dark haired guys they get ballistic.	2
Um that laundry pump situation was pretty nifty. And dude that ghetto tool box/marker holder was pretty legit. [NAME] not [NAME]	2
That's a very smart move. Anyway, congrats gamer girl, this is epic!	1
It's funny to imagine that they're calling [NAME], a married man, an incel.	1
I hated [NAME], but only because I thought he was good and played for the Cowboys. I feel the same way about [NAME] and [NAME]. 	0
[NAME]. I love that this is the top comment.	1
This is actually kinda cool, I like it!! 	1
Ah, well thank you. On an unrelated note, does “Benchys” mean boobs?	1
"My favorite so far is ""national emergency declares national emergency."""	1

I really hope this is what happens.	1

Couldn't have said it better myself	1
I enjoy shouting this at my husband and our friends when they're being especially nerdy.	1
Drink off those hangovers boys, we have the best team in the universe to watch	1
I’m proud of you. First few days are among the toughest.	1
I think it was Volantis, but yeah I agree.	1
As every politics expert knows, there's an eternal struggle between The Holy Roman Empire and Nazis. 	1

This hit me a little too close to home	2
Despite how much the Liberals and NDP apparently hate each other they really do work well together.	2

Oh wow this is big. Thanks for the heads up. Indeed! So many great memories that I still like to reflect back on. Thanks!	1
There is no 'H' in [NAME]. Source: |	2
Communism advocates a stateless society. They just got kicked in the head into believing Private Property is bad.	2
I'm still so sad we never got to see [NAME] witnessing his miracle baby's first steps. ☹️	0
"No, you are just suggesting someone be at the ""perfect"" level of looking for a relationship. Suggesting someone be the perfect anything is just sillyness. "	2

Thank you for the context. Everything makes sense now, I'd forgotten how... Certain kinds of people can be	1

There is nothing that back ups his claims. To me his views sounds more like wishful thinking.	0
Maybe even pay less with the UCP!	2
They were clearly ready for it. [NAME] is in [NAME] head.	2
At least he let you use an envoy. Those are seriously reliable. What color was the envoy	0
And what I really want is to have time only for myself, without wasting it at work	2
[NAME] with the truth that reality show does not = relevance.	2
That's perfectly fine. I'm sorry if I offended you in any way. Have a nice day.	0
[NAME] isn’t interested in ceremony but is interested in having time with you. Love this!	1
Imagine one day you found a comment that was rated exactly as it should be.	2
Technically, if [NAME] are right about him, then you already did nail him... soooooo...	2
Let's say for a moment that this was true. How does that get us the truth more often, and more reliably, than science?	2
Absolutely. It takes me back to a much happier time. When I die I hope I go to San Junipero.	1
you never wanna hear that but sadly people will say they love you when what they really mean is you are convenient.	0
[NAME], I love science.	1
Wow, essential oils can now replace oxygen	2

Honestly wish I could do this, I miss my long hair sometimes :(	0
Then stop electing those officials.	2
If I get another dog imma name it after a [NAME] song SO FUCKING CUUUUTE	1

Thanks. People on the sub are unreasonable. They think [NAME] is worth so much yet won't give up much for [NAME]	1
It won't be. Just a rumor.	0

At least her granddaughter will grow up to know her worth. *Oh wait.*	2
I came. So smooth. So brutal.	2
what's your MBTI type?, just curious btw	2
I will have nothing to do with this specter, who selectively appears to individuals and abandons others. No better than a cruel warlord.	0
that sucks, good luck next time!	0
My knees shattered and my collarbone broke just reading this	2
Not a good time to make life altering plans like moving in with him right now. Good luck, though. [NAME]	0
Must've misunderstood something about his injury. Thanks for pointing it out	1
Not a woosh but ok	2
Wow.....	1
Used to be the same with [NAME]	2
Meaning of life is to work 8h + a day and then convert your lifetime in coins you can spend on useless shit.	2
Thank you. Posted this to Facebook!	1

Best side quest ever!	1
This is why nobody takes feminism seriously!	2
Yes Thank you ! Someone might try to sue me because they pulled out and got pregnant ... use full body condoms if you think Facebook should support your baybeeees	1
At least you went out! For what it's worth, I definitely would have gone out with you if you were near me.	2

Wow. Racists are really coming out of the woodwork to excuse and defend racism. How sad.	0
Glad we aren't all like you , the world would have sucked	0
You didn’t offer any proof. She gave the dnc some money to stay afloat. You have yet to explain how that translates to them damaging [NAME] campaign	2
You just need to live your best life. Do the things that make you happy and don't dwell on any of the negatives.	1
thanks mate! yes, will buy some protein shakes today.. fucking expensive but better than starving i guess	1
I think you also underestimate how big Chelsea has become, especially in the States	0

Actually pretty :(( as [NAME] since the Hair is one big abomination and it could have been sooooo cool.	1
This is a powerful mood.	2
I always wondered where it was on ormond. I managed to find the toolbox last week on yamaoka as killer.	2
That was a fluid motion and it scared me	0
In the worst of the anger phase I took up running. It’s hard to stay in that state while your legs are burning that much.	0
You can cancel his single orb shot with melee too. Great for close range as discord headshot+melee is a shitload of damage.	2

Because I have no self-control and I hate myself.	0
Wish i had more up votes for you.	1
So, they want a more profitable split? Surprised they wouldn't go for the Discord store then. Didn't it offer even better a split?	2
Those cards are so cool	1
Cute pupper 😍😍😍	1
Yeah that’s one of the things I’m most worried about, still hopeful!	0
They do it because easily entertained people appears to be .... entertained by this. So they won't stop until people stop clicking on this trash	2
Should have drafted [NAME] and then never traded for THJ...Anyways, just happy we got [NAME] out of this finally.	2
You used the correct term. Good job.	1
He raped you. Leave. Now. Cut all contact. Easy answers here. You deserve far far better than this	1
Shoot, darn. You win again!	2
I look cuter in red P’s.	1

I love Subnautica. It's so, so terrifying but also beautiful and cool and I can wimp out and put it down any time. 	1
So is the OP still permabanned for no reason?	2
They are probably waiting for his harasser to pull a [NAME]. Filthy men.	0
And in the case of human trafficking, these people we should be given homes and protection instead of being tossed out to be abused in their home country	1
Thank you. As a father I found this hysterical. I'm legit laugh-crying rn	1
The men who didn't get other matches were being hypergamous in matching with a [NAME].	2
Oh I see...I keep trying to do the move everytime they're down. Thanks for the clarification.	1
Maybe Streamlight Strion if OP wants something Fenix PD35 sized? Havent used one myself but have heard good things.	1
LOL THEY DIED? like if you get reference	1
Like [NAME] said at the very end of the stream, “You’re still here and you can still do amazing things.”	1
Likely some more bitching about easily fixable features being swept under the rug by employees	2
In case anyone is wondering.. the money was a 20$ tip. Edit: 200$. I’ve been corrected.	1
Meta. If you feel otherwise, please speak now, or forever hold your bow.	2

Clamato? I see you Canada. And I like it. By the way, we need Wonderbars here in the US. Thanks	1
At least she didn't hot glue it	2
Yes please! OwO	2

Facial hair ability: [NAME] Looks like [NAME] got a bloody nose a week ago and hasn’t washed the blood out yet.	0
No since parries read the heavy press, not the release.	2
Excellent summary.	1
You’d want it in higher resolution I reckon	2
Aye me, it's shite and the folk who follow it all think there cool, bore off	2
SC6 has a colourful cast and is actually very easy to get into. So yeah man, go for it.	1
i think you misunderstood my comment. [NAME] over [NAME] any day	2
oh i just subscribed for the entire snap thing. i forgot to unsub and that post showed up in my feed, so i looked through the comments 	2
So what is then, the race of western peoples? You're treading in very problematic territory friend	1
This feels more like r/fellowkids to me. This is nothing compared to some of the more dystopian stuff the government has pushed out to be fair.	2
Megatron hanging out with [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]. This is like a fever dream	2
No, but we have beer and whiskey 	2
Yep. ~~(Also, I'm not interested in getting arrested so sorry.)~~	0
I don’t think you can be compelled to testify against someone else over a traffic violation, I would just feign ignorance	2
You’re probably recalling it correctly! It was maybe 2 years ago? Very ugly & sorted story	2
who knows, maybe people are cold and a dumpster fire is exactly what they're looking for to warm their bones	2
It's easy to overthink things online, I'm glad you gave him a chance.	1
Ah yes thank u, now the image is very funny	1
Due time to me is a couple of years. Have plenty of time though	2
Are there any Veracruz fans in the sub?	2
Go to McCalisters and get their sweet tea, THEN decide.	2
That’s what the shake is for, though. 	2
I like your baby😍	1
Dude was okay?! Oh thank god, i figured at best paralyzed from the waist down	1
Cool story bro.	1
"To be fair, ""Junior"" was released 25 years ago."	2
And also something against [NAME]. (My definition of [NAME] is just people at the bottom of love distribution)	2
Here’s to taking care of ourselves and reaching out to each other and getting the support we need!	1
"""My body is not me, but it is only one of the most popular songs ever."	2
Nirvana is a great band but a good chunk of people in their fan base are just awful (underratedly awful)	1
"It's not ""over"". Don't believe that. Focus on making friends. The more people in your network, it seems better."	1
❤️ you are a strong individual and there is an amazing amount of support behind you	1
Wow great analogy, exactly like that yes	1
The huge pics of [NAME] and [NAME] wedding looming over this dysfunction own	2
Thank you for that statement.	1
Also put icecream under the taco for a nice sundae suprise 👍	1
I considered that they might be doing that, actually...but I googled it and it didn’t seem to be true.	2
I like how he wrote many of the TRUE [NAME]. I wonder what a fake [NAME] believes in.	2
I live alone. Well, my dog... I do have to shut the door to keep him out. He gets too personal with his nose.	2
Bear your teeth at them and snarl like a dog	2
You’re thinking too technically about it. All politicians should be threatened with life in prison or execution if they go back on the word.	2
is this sub scared to talk about [NAME] getting arrested	0
More please!	2
As much fun as I've had yanking their chains, does anyone know the background behind these particular scam calls? I've gotten several of them lately.	1
love this! makes me want to go hiking at superstition this weekend.	1
Mad respect to her for being honest. I like how they consulted a dietician for their article to confirm a diet of cocaine and tapas was unhealthy lololololol.	1
[NAME] looking good for a big game	1
You are welcome, I have faced lot of sibling related issues. Hope things work out well for you.	1
I read TFTFD periodically, too - - I wasn't sure if the Mods there would leave the post up or tell LAOP to post on r/AskHotel instead.	2
She’s just not that into you, that’s what I think. You need to find an HL girlfriend and go have fun. 	1
You say 'A single MP' as if it's not that big of a deal. In my humble opinion, that's still probably one too many...	2
Accidentally dropped my cologne... stings the eyes	2
Both parents were drunk. Where were the small children? You helped her cheat and possibly contribute to child neglect. Awesome.	0
He needed the trophy in GTA?	2
Here in the UK I’m pretty sure I’ve never seen a taco	1

Why not ask a friend to do that?	2
[NAME] is definitely a good player, would probably be an [NAME] in the East, but fuck him lol	1
I'll message you when I have the time to play! :) Ty!	1

I kinda like that AC1 is still untouched. At least for now.	2
Have the zombies symbols available somewhere near for the Ra step, it's the most challenging	2
Thank you destruct	1
Yikes hope hes ok	2
Can genes be altered? I feel like I’ve heard something like this.	2
I know right?! My parents are extremely proud & grateful they don't have to help me pay debt.	1
And ALL of you will tune in next week because it’s the best trash TV ever created!	1
A work on yourself to change these issues. Or live a life without close connections. At the end of the day its depends on which you want.	1
Except the rest of the scoreboard is in blue (score and time) or white (team names). I did figure it out but certainly not straightforward	2
I need more videos of this cat, love its face xD	1
I'm on episode 8 and this is where the show has gotten boring af for me.	0
"""in2"" Is this a time saver over ""into""? This reporter says no."	2
Fun fact, His pants are on backwards in this pic	2
There were more but they got deleted for being duplicates. I removed a couple and the original posters removed a couple too.	2
Go watch the video where she does [NAME] makeup, [NAME] is super tall, especially compared to [NAME]. 	1
Geez, we still got about an hour left lol	1
[NAME] and clutch free throws are arch Nemesis	2
The president's own charity is under federal investigation so its time to drag out some so called progressives and show that there are bad people on all sides.	2
Lol. Well, I enjoyed our heart to heart either way 	1
I was so sure that was [NAME]	2
It would be funny and sad if he gets heart complications again	1
[NAME] plays with [NAME] for 2 minutes and he's already doing outlet passes lmao	2
Furthermore, that top part isn't even males only. The bottom part is tho.	2
Funny. The only people who have ever attacked me were conservative [NAME].	0
I would be so pissed if I was part of that coaching staff. That was unbelievable.	2
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry you had to deal with that. It sounds like you handled it really well. Kids are cruel. 	0
I just saw a post above this about people getting offended by jokes too easily	2
This makes me smile	1
I bet you're part of the gangs sneaking illegal, murderous drugs to other countries just to keep your family better fed than someone elses family. Fucking psychos	2

And even then... It won't be for long.	0
Close game but glad to see we came back in the end	1
You can love both [NAME] and the person you are with.	1

Not to be harsh but I feel like she has been dieting and working out for quite some time .. wouldn’t there be some change by now ?	2
This is getting old.	2
I forgot the Olympics was gonna happen there 😂 hopefully the signs and stuff will stay!	1

Much better thanks hun !	1
Thanks a million, because I was very much thinking the opposite hahaha	1
In 5 days bones would not be crusted over,sorry not buying it.	0
It wasn’t, [NAME] threw it out first, I just thought the no charisma was the better burn.	2
So in other words, he wooooshed	2
I don’t understand your question, why are you nervous if you are happy with the arrangement and he seems interested? 	0
I want to clarify that I am NOT scared. I punched the mirror because it looked at me wrong.	0
Liberal Grandma best Grandma.	1
Saw bad guy, arrested same.	0

It was when oil prices were higher. It’s primary export is petrol and the market slumping is hurting	2
Can’t fault you there	2
Obviously, as long as [NAME] commanded it then it's moral. Morality brought to you by stone age goat herders!	1
What is the job you are going to college for? Now days some jobs are more accepting with tattoos	2
CONGRATS! So happy for you. May life treat you kindly from now on.	1
Where do you think the [NAME] came from, before they arrived in Spain?	2

Yeah I realised that a bit too late. I still wanted to further explain myself regardless but thank you for being nice about it.	1
Great. Then he can levy a fine against person who took the photo.	1
Didn't seem patronising to me.. just kids being kids when confronted with a guy banging on a drum.	2

That was such a good cast. Loved that year.	1
Thanks - Glad I did not waste the money / gold	1
Well that's because they don't have a [NAME]	2

Your mental health. You might think its fine, but having to live a double / fake lifestyle is wearing on the best of us . 	0

I figure that if it was that easy, they would have given the task to somebody paid less.	2
It would hilarious if racist attacks against [NAME] propel him to the PMO.	1
No no no i didnt learn about that in my middle school bio class so it can't be real 😤	0

Hey, we have that problem too. Remember at least one number, folks. It's in your best interest in case of an emergency or jail.	2
Just in case you weren’t sure he’s an [NAME], he decided to obstruct 20% of his windshield to remind you. 	2
Wait, so do you have a source or not? Genuinely curious, it’s been three comments since the other guy asked	2
Funny how reddit works	1
Hellman's is owned by big pharma sheeple, they inject poisonous vaccines straight into sandwich spreads!	2
Because Lawn is an Americanism and I am from the UK so wouldn't ever use this word unless I am referring to a Lawnmower itself.	2
Me and the hubby watch every friday. Lol	1

oh my, the edge. i bet he comes with a pre-selected punisher skull emblem. 	2
Similarly, the Library of Congress is open and is absolutely beautiful. It's free and I highly recommend it even when the Smithsonian's aren't closed.	1

Very surprised he didn't frog leap at the guy the close the distance	2

Of course you don't think it's relevant. Your empathy for human life is tentative at best.	1
Nothing about that looks comfortable	0
How do you feel about pulling the plug on someone in a coma	2

I couldnt help but laugh out loud. Pure stupidity coming from the mother. No other way to put it	1
During [NAME] and [NAME] cross examination, [NAME] never contested the finding of the key. Never accused them of planting anything. 	2
How do you know what he can conceive of? Enough magical thinking.	2

Thank you for the advice. It is really really appreciated. 🙂	1
I wish [NAME] nothing but the best. I certainly won't ever forget his passion for the Mets.	2
Heard that too lol. And how [NAME] is fantastic on the ball, but the lack of assists puts him down as a player .	1
Agreed. Sadly, it's not uncommon enough, and it makes me sad because of the implications about mutual respect or the lack thereof.	0
delusional about dread being a scam (don't know how this would work) and more of these conspiracy theories with zero proof/	0
