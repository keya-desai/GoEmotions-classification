So what is then, the race of western peoples? You're treading in very problematic territory friend	2

Megatron hanging out with [NAME], [NAME], and [NAME]. This is like a fever dream	5

You are welcome, I have faced lot of sibling related issues. Hope things work out well for you.	2
I read TFTFD periodically, too - - I wasn't sure if the Mods there would leave the post up or tell LAOP to post on r/AskHotel instead.	4
She‚Äôs just not that into you, that‚Äôs what I think. You need to find an HL girlfriend and go have fun. 	2
You say 'A single MP' as if it's not that big of a deal. In my humble opinion, that's still probably one too many...	5

Freaking hate cats (that are like that)	0
Not sure where people get them from but I see people offering them out here and there so thought I'd take advantage	4

[NAME] You are the ultimate forhead Winner!!! Chose your price!	2
It's a self-identifying group, and they have killed quite a bit of people in their crusade for revenge. It's both absolutely pathetic and absolutely terrifying.	0
Tetris effect?	5
Number 20 to the rafters.	5
Minimum wage hurts small business more than it helps the poor.	3
[NAME] would say yes I think but that‚Äôs a hard pass from me	5

I'm sure they'll rob them back off her in no time	5
I thought it was funny ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	2

I would think they probably couldn‚Äôt take it if you tried	5
Absolutely not. What if a girl did this to you? Instant turn off. She doesn't seem interested. Keep the communication face-to-face at this point.	5

The world is backwards, nowadays. Where people defend _GaNgStAs_ because it's culturally and politically correct, and then shame those who protect and serve. Makes me bleed rage.	0

I'm so sorry that [NAME] has convinced you that his insane aggression isn't important.	3
Not sure how you got that outta my post. I play a lot of non-meta stuff all the time just because I find it fun or challenging.	2
Anybody that puts that many numbers in their handle is an obvious psychopath.	5

Boy, I literally didn't expect anyone to respond to this. Thanks, internet! I feel a tiny bit less alone.	2

Hi [NAME]!	5
LOL [NAME] you're too loveable for that. ‚ô°	2
I couldnt help but laugh out loud. Pure stupidity coming from the mother. No other way to put it	2
During [NAME] and [NAME] cross examination, [NAME] never contested the finding of the key. Never accused them of planting anything. 	5
How do you know what he can conceive of? Enough magical thinking.	5
I don't think any game mode has a guarantee anymore. I five stacked last night in unranked and waited 15mins for a game. TL feels the shortest	5

I mean most players get that	5
Thank you for the advice. It is really really appreciated. üôÇ	2
I wish [NAME] nothing but the best. I certainly won't ever forget his passion for the Mets.	5
Heard that too lol. And how [NAME] is fantastic on the ball, but the lack of assists puts him down as a player .	2
Agreed. Sadly, it's not uncommon enough, and it makes me sad because of the implications about mutual respect or the lack thereof.	3
delusional about dread being a scam (don't know how this would work) and more of these conspiracy theories with zero proof/	1
[NAME] still pulling in the numbers. Doubt we'll ever see [NAME] on PPV again but [NAME] is still a draw with the right opponent	5
It makes more sense now.	5
I love the '1000 paw slap' at the end.	2
They are wingers. [NAME] is not. That's about I it tbh. Also they are loans and we may not keep them.	5
Didn‚Äôt they change his name and give his younger brother his original name? I think they did this is Game of Thrones too.	5
This is the best one yet.	2

The Evergreen debacle shows how badly that goes in real life. Turns out the Diversity Coalition would actually hack [NAME] into pieces and parade her organs around.	5
Unless you're trying it with dollarstore shit, don't risk wasting the money. Just enjoy it.	2

Women aren't smart enough to see an intellectual kino du art like [NAME] multiple times	2
Gotcha. I see my clarification above. I sincerely apologize that anything I wrote made you feel that you needed to enforce your boundaries.	2
Literally every man, hell every person, has things that weigh on them. One type of person gets a lot more positive support though. 	5
I‚Äôm surprised she didn‚Äôt name him Allesandrostien	4

Drugs are a hell of a drug...	0
I.e., you don't know what socialism is and what it strives for.	5

This is extremely dangerous. And would completely marginalize anyone without a chip. Making it an absolute necessity for everyone to have a chip.	1
Not sure if you're joking. Not sure if I disagree. But since the point of high school is daytime teenager containment google would not accomplish that.	0
Killing goblins is not murder hoboing. [NAME] should have done that himself, really. 	4
